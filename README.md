# Binary Classification via a Similarity Graph
All code files associated with my master's thesis at York University

This project implements a novel graph-based approach for video classification which provides more interpretability than state-of-the art deep learning approaches.

Moreover, by utilizing similarities between unlabeled data as well as labeled data, enables semi-supervised learning. 

The dataset of this project is publicly accessible in [[1]](#1). This dataset includes electrical pulses carried by the optic nerve's cells to the brain in response to a movie shown in front of an eye. The movie is included in the dataset as well.

Our model predicts the cell responses based on the input movie with up to 75% accuracy. However, the main advantage of our model is not accuracy, but interpretabiliy. Our model enables clear interpreations and relations between the cell responses and input features.
