Jupyter notebooks to run when you want to try a new grouping algorithm for the responses.
* 05_simple_features_toy_examples/05_group_neurons.ipynb: generate the new response signal and save it on disc for further processing.
* 14_comparison/11_glr_sdp_gdpa.ipynb: run a single training-validation round with any of the three training methods.
* 09_sift3d/10_bglr_assess.ipynb: run randomized experiments with the B-GLR model.
* 09_sift3d/08_visualize_sift_keypoints.ipynb: visualize the optimized M, its diagonal entries and the most contributing 3D-SIFT features.
* 17_interpretation/02_M_eigenvectors.ipynb: visualize the optimized M's eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
