"""
This package helps you create and update training and validation datasets.
Datapoints are chosen randomly.
Edit with respect to data_handler_01.py:
This version adds 'ind_min' and 'ind_max' parameters to the 'data_params' as they are data-related parameters as well.
    ind_min - minimum possible index of the randomly chosen datapoint
    ind_max - maximum possible index of the randomly chosen datapoint
You have the option to force your datasets to be equally (50-50) distributed between the two labels.
